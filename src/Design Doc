LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
private int x1 - x value of first coordinate
private int x2 - x value of second coordinate
private int y1 - y value of first coordinate
private int y2 - y value of second coordinate

Constructors:
public LinearEquation(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2) - shows linear equation of the line

Method:
public int pointUno(int x1, int y1) - scanner intake for the first point of the linear equation
public int pointTwo(int x2, int y2) - scanner intake for the second point of the linear equation
public double distanceBetweenUs(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2) - y value subtracted and x value subtracted, then divide y by x
public double slope (double daSlope) - equation for slopes that calculates the value of slope
(remember to have a (double) in the equation so it converts into double before it erases any value)
public double yIntercept(double daYInt) - returns back y intercept
public String toString() - returns all asked information about the equation.
