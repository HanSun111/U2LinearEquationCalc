LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
private int x1 - x value of first coordinate
private int x2 - x value of second coordinate
private int y1 - y value of first coordinate
private int y2 - y value of second coordinate

Constructors:
public LinearEquation(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2) - shows linear equation of the line

Method:
public string pointUno() - scanner intake ints for the first point of the linear equation and for later, return comma and brackets along with the x and y coordinates
public string pointDos() - scanner intake ints for the second point of the linear equation, return comma and brackets along with the x and y coordinates

public double distanceBetweenUs() - x value of point 2 subtracted by the x value of point 1 then square, add it by y value of point 2 subtracted by the y value of point 1 squared, squareroot the value.

public double LaSlope () - equation for slopes that calculates the value of slope
(remember to have a (double) in the equation so it converts into double before it erases any value)

public double yInt() - returns back y intercept

public String allNeededInfo() - returns all asked information about the equation.

EquationRunner.java
1. ask user to enter 1st coordinate
2. ask user to enter 2nd coordinate
3. LinearEquation runs, return all the mentioned data to show user.
4. input a random real x value and let it calculate the y value, returns the coordinates.
